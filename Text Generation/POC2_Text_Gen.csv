The nature of the data is time dependant,"The nature of the data is time dependent, so the quality of data can vary from person to person and time to time depending on the type of data collected. The quality of a data is also dependent on the time period in which it is collected. This can change from one data collection method to another, depending on how time-dependent the data collection is. The nature of data collection can also change from method to method depending on time of collection, which can have a significant impact on its quality."
The total size of the existing data that has to be processed by the application is less than 1gb,"The total size of the existing data that has to be processed by the application is less than 1gb. The total amount of data that will be processed will not exceed 1gb, so the application will not be required to process more than 1GB of data. The application will only need to process the data that can be processed within the current data set to reduce the processing time to less than one GB. The existing data set will not need to be expanded to handle the new data set, as it is too small to be of any significant value."
Current way of solving the problem is where a human expert decides.,"The current way of solving the problem is where a human expert decides. In this case, the expert decides what to do about the problem. The current way to solve a problem is to use human experts to make a decision. This is the most effective way to do it, as it allows the expert to make up their mind about how to solve the problem without having to be involved in the decision-making process in the first place.

"ML has two different ways to learn about the future based on the past. If the past data happened without your control, ML treats it as certain. If you decided what to do in the past, ML considers that there is only a certain probability that your decision is correct and tries to improve that decision in the future.","ml has two different ways to learn about the future based on the past. If the past data happened without your control, ml treats it as certain. If you decided what to do in the past, ml considers that there is only a certain probability that your decision is correct and tries to improve that decision in the future. This is different from the approach used in which ml treats the data as certain and attempts to improve the decision based on it. This approach considers that the data can only be improved if it can be shown to be more likely to be correct than the previous one."
"We are currently experiencing 12-14% customer churn every year. Given that a customer is worth $10,000 for us and we have 5000 customers, we lose 6-7 million USD every year in churn.","The company is experiencing 12-14% customer churn every year. The company loses 6-7 million dollars every year in churn. A customer is worth $10,000 for the company, and the company has 5000 customers. This means that every customer that the company loses is worth less than $5,000. This is because each customer is churned at a higher rate than the company""s other customers. Therefore, the company is losing more than $6 million dollars each year in customer churn."
"My end users are churn management and sales teams dealing with the customers. At the beginning of every quarter, the application will alert the churn management and sales teams with the customers who are likely to churn for the quarter. The churn management team will then work with the sales team in addressing this issue","At the beginning of every quarter, the application alerts the churn management and sales teams with the customers who are likely to churn for the quarter. The churn management team will then work with the sales team to address this issue. The application is aimed at end users who deal with customers churning and their sales teams dealing with the churning customers. My end users are churn management teams and the customers they deal with are dealing with. They will work together to address the issue at the start of each quarter. "
"Any ML application will have error. That is not a big deal. But a corner case is a gross error that can lead you to a legal or ethical trouble. For example, recently a large company wanted to automate their resume selection process. But that preferentially eliminated all women. It only selected men. Similarly, a chat application started giving racial abuses. Giving a wrong answer, eg., if you say what time is the train, you say the flight is delayed, they will laugh at you. But if you say what time is the train, and you get an abuse in response, then that’s a legal issue.","The corner case is a gross error that can lead you to a legal or ethical trouble.

"So, a corner case is an error, an inappropriateness that can lead you to trouble. Particularly this is to be noticed when you are trying to automate a system. When you are trying to build a decision support system, for your own internal employee they will come and say, “hey you know what its giving an inappropriate answer”. SO anyway it is filtered by them. But if you are exposing your application to the client, in applications where you are directly communicating with your client – as a decision support or automation, you have to be very very aware of what are the corner cases that can be there in the business. So think of racial, ethical, cultural offensives that you can do as part of the errors."," corner case is an error, an inappropriateness that can lead you to trouble.

" If your problem is complicated, more than one component. Its time for you to see if you may break the problem to have multiple components. Mention that these are mutually exclusive problems (predict a value/behavior) and hence strongly recommend choosing one option or ensure to breakdown the problem.","There are mutually exclusive problems (predict a value/behavior and choose one option or ensure to breakdown the problem. If your problem is complicated, more than one component can be used to break the problem to have multiple components, so it's important to choose just one option and focus on solving one problem at a time. If you have to choose between two solutions, it's better to focus on one solution and avoid trying to solve both problems at the same time, as they're mutually exclusive. "
